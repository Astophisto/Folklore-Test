    <h2>Folklore</h2>
   <strong> Folklore </strong> is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people, culture or subculture.[1] This includes oral traditions such as tales, myths, legends, proverbs, poems, jokes, and other oral traditions.[2][3] This also includes material culture, such as traditional building styles common to the group. Folklore also encompasses customary lore, taking actions for folk beliefs, including folk religion, and the forms and rituals of celebrations such as Christmas, weddings, folk dances, and initiation rites.[2]

   <p> The academic study of folklore is called folklore studies or folkloristics, and it can be explored at the undergraduate, graduate, and Ph.D. levels. </p>
